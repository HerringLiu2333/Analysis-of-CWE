/**
 * @name CVE-2024-58007
 * @description Detects incorrect bounds checking when validating presence of struct fields in
 *  Qualcomm socinfo, where offsetof() was used instead of offsetofend() to gate
 *  access to serial_num. On SoCs exposing older socinfo versions without the
 *  serial_num field, this allows reading past the end of the socinfo struct from
 *  SMEM, exposing a bogus constant serial number (out-of-bounds read).

 * @remediation When checking for presence of trailing struct fields provided by firmware or
 *  shared memory, validate that the end of the field lies within the available
 *  item size using offsetofend(), not just the start offset via offsetof().
 *  Do not expose or access fields for socinfo versions that do not include them.

 *  soc: qcom: socinfo: Avoid out of bounds read of serial number
 *  commit 22cf4fae6660b6e1a583a41cbf84e3046ca9ccd0 upstream.
 *  
 *  On MSM8916 devices, the serial number exposed in sysfs is constant and does
 *  not change across individual devices. It's always:
 *  
 *    db410c:/sys/devices/soc0$ cat serial_number
 *    2644893864
 *  
 *  The firmware used on MSM8916 exposes SOCINFO_VERSION(0, 8), which does not
 *  have support for the serial_num field in the socinfo struct. There is an
 *  existing check to avoid exposing the serial number in that case, but it's
 *  not correct: When checking the item_size returned by SMEM, we need to make
 *  sure the *end* of the serial_num is within bounds, instead of comparing
 *  with the *start* offset. The serial_number currently exposed on MSM8916
 *  devices is just an out of bounds read of whatever comes after the socinfo
 *  struct in SMEM.
 *  
 *  Fix this by changing offsetof() to offsetofend(), so that the size of the
 *  field is also taken into account.
